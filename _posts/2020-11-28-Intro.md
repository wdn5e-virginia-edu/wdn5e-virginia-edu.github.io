## Progressive Web Apps
involve javascript and several other standard web technologies:
* **scope** to associate a PWA with its origin
  * optionally to coordinate several PWAs from the same origin
* **web worker** threads to offload and separately run javascript
  * which might stall the UI if run in the main thread  
* **cache** of app assets -- the images and other resources needed by the web app
  * to ensure offline availability
  * in API-accessible storage
  * more configurable than usual browser cache
  * programmatically available to javascript, both in the main thread and in a
* **service worker** -- a special-purpose web worker servicing the PWA's scope
* an event-based **fetch API** to replace XMLHttpRequest APIs for AJAX to include 
  * listening for these events, primarily in the service worker as well as 
  * creating these events, primarily in the main thread UI code

## Infrastructure-in-a-Box
Using these features, PWA service workers can go beyond simply caching their assets
* to proxy main-thread HTTP requests
** modifying or storing requests or responses, or even
* to service them, providing a local web service for custom use

## AMP
Originally an acronym for Accelerated Mobile Pages, AMP improves app performance by
* proscribing worst practices
* prescribing best practices
* providing its own support javascript
* and more-performant replacement tags for some HTML elements

Initially allowing no app javascript beyond simple UI event handlers,
AMP now allows app javascript
* associated with custom app UI components
* triggered by user actions
* run in separate worker threads

## Future amppwa.app
posts, sample code, and working apps will build upon these ideas.
* There may be more PWA than AMP.
* I will try for freely usable code, that is, under some permissive license.

* Search again weekly or so for new posts here or apps.
* Or to save yourself some bother, [let me know](mailto:niebel@virginia.edu) to send you brief mail without ad content at each post or app update.
* In upcoming post/s, I'll try
  * to work web **Notifications** and **Web Push** into my service worker/s 
  * to make it easier for you to keep tabs on this work
